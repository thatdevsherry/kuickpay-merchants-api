# Kuickpay Merchants API

A NestJS app that sets up a service to work with [kuickpay](https://kuickpay.com/).

I'm using this as a learning project, once it's complete, might be good for production :P

Kuickpay doesn't provide an SDK that allows easier onboarding. This might help them out indirectly. Plus for simple use-cases, companies wouldn't need to build a kuickpay handler from scratch. Drop this in and boom.
